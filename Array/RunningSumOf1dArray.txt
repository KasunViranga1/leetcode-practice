/**
 * This class provides a solution to the running sum problem.

class Solution {
    /**
     * This method calculates the running sum of an array of integers.
     * 
     * The running sum of an array is an array where each element is the sum of all elements up to that index.
     * 
     * @param nums The input array of integers.
     * @return The running sum of the input array.
     * 
     * Example:
     * Input: [1, 2, 3, 4]
     * Output: [1, 3, 6, 10]
     * Explanation: The running sum is calculated as follows:
     *  - At index 0, the sum is 1.
     *  - At index 1, the sum is 1 + 2 = 3.
     *  - At index 2, the sum is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.
     *  - At index 3, the sum is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.
